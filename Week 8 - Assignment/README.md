# Week 8 - Assignment

* Load the SVHN dataset and prepare it using the appropriate tensor and normalisation transforms.
* Use an appropriate CNN architecture that can extract features from the 32×32 RGB images.
* Train the network using a suitable loss function and optimiser until it reaches reasonable accuracy.
* Evaluate the model on the SVHN test set and report the final accuracy.
* Show example predictions from the model, including ones that it got wrong.

# Extension Task

* Research and use data augmentation to further improve the model’s performance for training examples that the model got wrong.
